A small tool to convert HTML files generated by Notion in PDF files with justified text.
* Pre-requisites:
   *  Selenium package for Python.
* Input:
    * ZIP files generated by Notion containing the html files and resources.
* Output:
    * PDF files with justified text.

Run the script in the directory where are located the ZIPs, it will generate the PDFs and delete the ZIPs.

**Note:** The EXE file was generated for my architecture, but you can use the .py file to regenerate it.
